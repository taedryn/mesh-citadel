# Forklift Certified License

Forklift Certified License, version 0.69.420, by Aria Salvatrice.

## Preamble

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to make it easy for capital to fuck you over. By contrast, the Forklift Certified License is intended to guarantee my homies have the freedom to:

0. Fork this work
1. Lift some good shit from this work

It's not following the OSI definition of open-source because i don't give a damn how capital defines its needs. Also your lawyer gonna be terrified by this shit and that's the whole damn point lmao: if you can pay a lawyer, you can pay me for a license that doesn't look so fucked up; but if you can't pay a lawyer, you're not worth suing.

It's not compatible with other licenses because it doesn't need to be. It's copy-pasted from the anti-capitalist license with stuff i stole from the ml5js license plus some shit from the opinionated queer license and i added a clause about Palestine liberation because operating a forklift means you can lift up the oppressed.
